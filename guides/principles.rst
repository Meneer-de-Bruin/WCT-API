Principles
==========

Maturity
========
We want to strive to a fully mature RESTful services as defined by the Richardson maturity model (<link>). 
Important here is that we not only adhere to the REST principals (<link>), but also implement Hypertext As 
The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS).

Request
=======
All REST API calls make use of HTTPS.
 
The format of exchanged data is JSON. This applies to both requests and responses.


Versioning
==========
There are a number of ways to implement versioning. The easiest is using a version specifier in the URI.
The most complex way is using content negation <links>. As the APIâ€™s will be primarily used in the WCT 
project itself it is advised to use the most simple way possible. So using version specifier (e.g. number) in the URI.
 
Authentication
==============
To use an REST API the user must be authenticated. The proposal is to authenticate once and return a token 
that can then be used in all REST API calls. 

Data format
===========
Although all kind of data formats can be supported it is advised to keep this simple and choose one, e.g. JSON (preferred) or XML.
